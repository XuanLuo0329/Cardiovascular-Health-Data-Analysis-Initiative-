   - Utilized **SPSS Modeller** for data analysis and predictive modeling.

2. **Iteration 2: OSAS (Open Source Analytics Solution)**
   - Leveraged **Python and Jupyter** for comprehensive data analysis and model development.

3. **Iteration 3: BDAS (Big Data Analytics Solutions)**
   - Employed **GitHub, AWS (EC2/AMI), Jupyter, PySpark, and Spark** for big data analysis and scalable solutions.

The final reports for all three iterations are available in this repository. Please refer to them for detailed information.
